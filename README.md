# User data extraction from Instagram hashtag

This is the data gathering and preparation for a uni project, in which I used the data obtained to create a bipartite graph of tattoo artists and the cities visited when making tours.
The users are extracted based on certain hashtags used in the posts, then each user is manually edited to get the fields that cannot be automatically extracted because of the lack of a given format in users' profiles. 
Note that the Artist class is prepared to fit the requirements for my project, feel free to edit the code for your own purpose.
